        Hello there! My name is Bagus. I work as a Software Engineer and have a passion for 
        experimenting with user interfaces and creating products that deliver exceptional user 
        experiences. While my expertise lies in mobile development and front-end work, 
        I also find joy in integrating various software components together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I'm working as a Software Engineer (Flutter) at a startup based in Singapore,
        where I'm focused on building new and exciting apps after graduating.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before that, I worked at a software consultant company in Bali for about a year.
        I spent majority of my time there on enhancing existing legacy code and developing new features, 
        particularly those associated with local businesses projects.

      <h2 class='mt-1'>Beginnings of my <Accent text='journey'/></h2>
      <p class='mt-4'>
        I'm born and grew up in Bali, Indonesia and I'm very grateful to have taken a very traditional route into the fields
        of Software Engineering and Computer Science.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey with programming started at university. Although I faced some challenges and uncertainties during 
        my first year, the onset of COVID-19 and the quarantine give me quite a lot of time to code.
        This, greatly contributed to my improvement over the next few years.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my college years, I was actively involved in the highly ambitious software engineering club called
        <a href="https://sicudayana.com" target='_blank', class='cursor-newtab'>
          <CustomLink text="SIC (Student Inovation Centre)" />
        </a> 
        , where I led a team of 8 people. We organized sharing sessions to discuss various 
        technology and software engineering topics. I also took part in an immersive project where we 
        collaborated to create a project from scratch. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, I joined a startup called Inspix Technologies, working as a Product Manager to help launch their first MVP 
        product, which was supported by the Ministry of Industry in Indonesia and based in Denpasar, Bali.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my later years, I also joined the 
        <a href="https://kampusmerdeka.kemdikbud.go.id/" target='_blank', class='cursor-newtab'>
          <CustomLink text="Kampus Merdeka" />
        </a> 
        program (8 months intensives bootcamp held by Indonesian goverment), which sparked my passion for coding. I continued to
        thrive and developed a strong love for coding, especially when it involves creating user interfaces
