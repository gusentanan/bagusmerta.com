      <p class='mt-4'>
        I'm born and grew up in Bali, Indonesia and I'm very grateful to have taken a very traditional route into the fields
        of Software Engineering and Computer Science.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey with programming started at Udayana University. Although I faced some challenges and uncertainties during 
        my first year, the onset of COVID-19 and the quarantine give me quite a lot of time to learn software engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my college years, I was actively involved in the highly ambitious informatics club called
        <a href="https://sicudayana.com" target='_blank', class='cursor-newtab'>
          <CustomLink text="SIC (Student Innovation Centre)" />
        </a> 
        , where I led a team of 8 people. We organized sharing sessions to discuss various 
        technology and software engineering topics. I also took part in an immersive project where we 
        collaborated to create a project from scratch. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, I joined a startup called Inspix Technologies, working as a Product Manager to help launch their first MVP 
        product, which was supported by the Ministry of Industry in Indonesia and based in Denpasar, Bali.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my later years, I also joined the 
        <a href="https://kampusmerdeka.kemdikbud.go.id/" target='_blank', class='cursor-newtab'>
          <CustomLink text="Kampus Merdeka" />
        </a> 
        program (8 months intensives bootcamp), This experience set a strong foundation in software engineering for me, which helped me a lot in the next several years.
