return new Promise.start(`
   Do it Now!
   Don't let your feelings hold you back.
`);
```

So I randomly stumbled upon this new podcast with Chris William and David Goggins.
And guess what? It's like I've got this instant insight into his whole deal. 

If thereâ€™s something that youâ€™d like to do or some condition youâ€™d like to be true, let it happen.


###  Believe itâ€™s going to happen.

###  Write it down.

###  Now, start chatting it up with yourself.

###  Iâ€™ve got this.

###  You (I) can do it.

The big thing here is taking action. The brain can be a bit of a slowpoke, so just get moving, literally. 
Tell your body to go before your brain's even figured it out.

Want to write a book? Easy, stare at a blank page for an hour each day until words start popping out.

If you'd like to run stare at your shoes for a few minutes until you start running.

If you'd like to write code, just open your favorite Editor (IDE) for a few moment.

## That's Insane ðŸ¤£
Sure, there are limits to what you know, but sometimes you've gotta trick that brain of yours into action. 
Take a cue from David Goggins, put yourself out there, and let the rest catch up.

Sometimes such beliefs and self-talk can border on the edge of insanity.

But anyone whoâ€™s ever done anything of note has dipped their toe in the pools of madness before.

## The point is the same

And you know what? It goes for a simple life too. Fly under the radar, lay low for a while, lay low forever and enjoy 
the simplicity of existence.

That's it for this post. I hope it can be some kind of useful to anyone who reads it.
Feel free to always reach me outâ€”I'd love to receive your thoughts on this piece!
