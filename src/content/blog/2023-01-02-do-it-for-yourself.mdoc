So I randomly stumbled upon this new podcast with Chris William and David Goggins. 
And guess what? It's like I've got this instant insight into his whole deal. üëâ [Podcast](https://youtu.be/ngvOyccUzzY?si=XtC0aHcEWcSkf7B9)

If there‚Äôs something that you‚Äôd like to do or some condition you‚Äôd like to be true, let it happen.

### Believe it‚Äôs going to happen.

### Write it down.

### Now, start chatting it up with yourself.

### I‚Äôve got this.

### You (I) can do it.

The big thing here is taking action. The brain can be a bit of a slowpoke, so just get moving, literally. 
Tell your body to go before your brain's even figured it out.

Want to write a book? Easy, stare at a blank page for an hour each day until words start popping out.

If you'd like to run stare at your shoes for a few minutes until you start running.

If you'd like to write code, just open your favorite Editor (IDE) for a few moment.

## That's Insane ü§£
Sure, there are limits to what you know, but sometimes you've gotta trick that brain of yours into action. 
Take a cue from David Goggins, put yourself out there, and let the rest catch up.

Sometimes such beliefs and self-talk can border on the edge of insanity.

But anyone who‚Äôs ever done anything of note has dipped their toe in the pools of madness before.

## The point is the same

And you know what? It goes for a simple life too. Fly under the radar, lay low for a while, lay low forever and enjoy 
the simplicity of existence.

Oh, and by the way, I've always been a fan of David Goggins because, well, it feels like he's past story is relatable to me." ‚úåÔ∏è
