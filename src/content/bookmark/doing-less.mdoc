title: "Want to Be More Productive? Try Doing Less."
description: "If we want to ramp up our productivity and happiness at home and at work, we should actually be doing less. But that’s incredibly difficult as you’re balancing work, parenting, friendships, and more. When you stop doing the things that make you feel busy but aren’t getting you results, then you end up with more than enough time for what matters."
